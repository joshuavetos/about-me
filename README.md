# Vetos Systems: The Fail-Closed Governance Stack
    
    A repository documenting how complex AI and industrial systems are audited, constrained, and deliberately halted when certainty is insufficient.
    
    ## Philosophy
    
    - Reliability over appearance.
    - Fail-closed over silent degradation.
    - Systems must halt when truth cannot be proven.
    
    ## Core Stack Overview
    
    | Artifact | Failure Mode Solution |
    |---|---|
    | `guardrail_engine.py` | Probabilistic Refusal |
    | `audit_pipeline.py` | Immutable Data Lineage |
    | `bounded_agent.py` | Policy-Enforced Actuation |
    | `rap_kernel.py` | Systemic Risk Bonding |
    | `concur_guard.py` | Deterministic Financial Gating |
    | `drift_monitor.py` | Statistical Health Validation |
    | `industrial_guard.py` | Operational Technology (OT) Safety |
    | `stress_cycle_v3.py` | Mechanism Design Stress Testing |
    
    ## Macro Engine
    
    The `tools/macro_engine_v2.py` is a specialized tool for institutional risk monitoring using GARCH volatility and Net Liquidity.
    
    ## What This Is Not
    
    This repository is **not a demo reel**.
    It is a **working record of failure-first system design**.
    The artifacts here demonstrate one core competency:
    > **The ability to design systems that stop themselves when certainty is insufficient.**
    
    Every system in this repository is built to:
    - fail deterministically,
    - expose why it failed,
    - log the failure in machine-readable form,
    - and only proceed when explicit conditions are satisfied.
