## Structural Drivers of Hiring Dysfunction (System-Level Analysis)

The observed failures of the modern hiring pipeline are not accidental or transitional. They arise from four reinforcing system-level dynamics that make inefficiency stable and rational for institutional actors.

### 1. The Potemkin Pipeline (Compliance Theater)
In many enterprise contexts, job postings and interview pipelines exist primarily to legitimize a pre-selected hire (internal promotion, referral, or executive preference). Public postings satisfy EEO/OFCCP requirements, while external applicants unknowingly participate in a false tournament. High rejection rates are not evidence of rigor, but artifacts of retroactive justification.

**Implication:** Ghost jobs are often filled roles with ongoing performative searches, not unfilled demand.

### 2. Application DoS and Signal Collapse
Zero-cost applications (e.g., “Easy Apply,” bot-assisted mass submissions) collapse signal quality. Single postings attract 1,000+ applicants, the majority unqualified. Recruiters respond by tightening ATS filters to extreme thresholds, not to identify talent, but to reduce volume to human-manageable levels. Candidates then increase application volume to compensate, accelerating the spiral.

**Implication:** The system is locked in an adversarial feedback loop that destroys information.

### 3. Asymmetric Risk Optimization (False Negatives Preferred)
Hiring systems are mathematically optimized to tolerate infinite false negatives (rejecting strong candidates) to avoid a single false positive (a bad hire). The cost of missing a high performer is invisible; the cost of a bad hire is immediate, documentable, and career-damaging.

**Implication:** The pipeline selects for conformity and “not obviously bad,” not excellence.

### 4. Vendor Incentive Stabilization
Job boards and ATS vendors profit from high friction and high volume. Efficient matching would reduce ad inventory, recruiter seat sales, and premium filtering tools. Platform design choices (frictionless apply, promoted listings) exacerbate noise, then sell mitigation back to employers.

**Implication:** Market incentives actively resist optimization.

### System Conclusion
The hiring pipeline is not broken — it is functioning as designed under regulatory, economic, and risk constraints. Reform requires structural intervention; individual optimization (better resumes, more interviews) cannot overcome system equilibria.
