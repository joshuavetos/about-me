# Probes

This folder contains investigative probes.

A probe is a small, executable experiment used to interrogate real systems
and observe how they behave under specific conditions. Probes are written
to gather information that cannot be reliably obtained from documentation,
specifications, or theoretical reasoning alone.

Probes are exploratory by design. They may target edge cases, malformed
inputs, ambiguous requests, or failure conditions in order to surface
response patterns, inconsistencies, or hidden assumptions in the system
being observed.

The contents of this folder are not products, tools, or frameworks.
They are ad-hoc investigations meant to be run, inspected, and revisited
over time. Unexpected behavior is treated as signal, not error.

Each file in this folder represents a question asked of the world.
